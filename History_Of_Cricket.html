        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the center of which is a 22-yard pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, known as the bowler, "bowls" (pitches) the ball from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at the other end, with an "over" being completed once they have legally done so six times.

        <h2>Origins</h2>
        <p>
            Cricket originated in south-east England, becoming established in the 18th century and developing globally in the 19th and 20th centuries. International matches have been played since 1844, and Test cricket began, retrospectively recognized, in 1877. Cricket's origins are obscure and the earliest definite reference is in south-east England in the middle of the 16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, leading to the first international matches in the late 19th century.

        <h2>Modern Era</h2>
        <p>
            In the 20th century, cricket evolved into a major sport, with the advent of limited-overs formats such as One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 (T20) cricket. The game continues to evolve with new formats and tournaments, making it one of the most popular sports worldwide. The ICC, the sport's governing body, oversees international competitions including the ICC Cricket World Cup and the ICC T20 World Cup.
